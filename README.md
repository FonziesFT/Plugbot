# Plug.dj is officially shutting down.

Although I don't use Plug.dj anymore, it appears that the website itself has officially been shut down (or will be soon).  It is sad to see that the company was unable to support itself any longer.  :(


# Please use [plug.bot enhanced developed by contributor ebola777](https://github.com/ebola777/Plugbot-Enhanced).

Hello everyone!  This is the developer of plug.bot.  I've not been maintaining this project for over a year, due to a mixed lack of interest in plug.dj as well as simple lack of time available to spend on it.  Thankfully, an awesome developer named ebola777 has revived plug.bot with his version.  Please, feel free to use it!  It has nearly everything people loved about plug.bot, except it *actually works* in the present-day Plug.dj environment.

Thanks!


## plug.bot

A collection of extensions to the growing online DJing website, [plug.dj](http://plug.dj).  The source code is written in JavaScript and uses the Plug.dj API anywhere possible.  Easily embeddable as a bookmark in your favorite browser.  Initially inspired by TechGuard's AutoWoot script from April 2012.


### Features List ###

Feature | Purpose
--------|--------
Auto Woot | Automatically WOOT! each song as it is played
Auto Queue | Automatically add yourself back to the DJ Waitlist once you've been moved back into the crowd
Userlist | A dynamic list of every user in the room, color-coded by their current vote.  Green = "Woot", Red = "Meh", White = No vote  Special usergroups (i.e. moderator) are denoted by the icon you'd normally see in the chat
Toggle UI | Allows you to easily configure your Plug.bot experience;  enable or disable each of its features at the click of a button.  Red = Off, Green = On
Hide Video | Hides videos from view on the site -- this is in effect until disabled
Skip Video | This is exactly like hide video, except it additionally mutes the audio and will automatically re-enable everything after the current video is over



### Bugfixes ###

This is where I will map out any bug fixing, in other words small issue solving that doesn't equate to a full version change.  Started September 14, 2013.

Piece of cake!  Just drag this code to your bookmarks bar and rename it to whatever you like.
